# Debug Health

This is a small book of health guide for for people who need to work long hours
behind a desk, aiming to help everyone understand the dangers of sitting for
long periods at a desk and, based on existing scientific literature and years of
personal experience, provide some practical suggestions to improve the working
environment, adjust working and living habits, so as to maintain a healthy
working and living state.

The desk workers we're talking about here include, but are not limited to,
programmers, designers, writers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and
millions of others who spend their days hunched over desks in office cubicles,
working [long hours](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU) in pursuit of their
livelihood and dreams.

As for myself, I'm neither a nutritionist, nor a doctor, fitness trainer, or
rehabilitation specialist—far from being an expert in any field. I'm a [software
engineer](https://github.com) and indie hacker—just an ordinary desk worker.
Therefore, this can only be considered a "small guide" to health, far from being
an authoritative manual. The experiences and insights shared here represent only
my personal views and are for reference only—but I believe they're quite
valuable. "Don't just take my word for it, see the results"—as shown in the
photo below. :-)

In the world of software engineering, when our code has problems, we have
various debugging methods, but when our health has issues, many people often
feel helpless and let the situation deteriorate. I hope this small guide serves
as a debugging manual - not for code, but for your health. Here, you'll learn
about:

- How to create an ergonomic work environment
- How to find time for appropriate exercise in your busy schedule
- How to maintain a healthy weight and abundant energy through proper diet
- How to achieve high-quality rest and relaxation
